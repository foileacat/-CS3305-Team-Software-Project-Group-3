            "Hey Kiddo! How did you sleep? Well I hope! I'm sure you're excited to be home again, you've been away at college for quite some time!",
            "You look so different! I'm not sure the village people will even recognise you. That's okay too though!",
            "However, I have bad news. The village is not the same as you left it. A few years ago, the spell that has protected our village for 1000 years broke!",
            "The spell was so ancient and old, not even the oldest elders knew how to cast it again. The village fell into chaos. That's why I havent visited you!",
            "The villagers are unhappy, and bad things are happening everywhere. Monsters are roaming the lands and back luck has cursed everyone!",
            "That's why it's so good you're here! You see, there is a way to fix the spell, but only someone young, and pure of heart can do it.",
            "To fix the spell, you need to gather the four ancient gems that were created by an ancient magick many years ago.",
            "They're scattered around the village, and I'm afraid I cannot help you find them. You must go alone!",
            "However, I did hear that the forest witch might have one of the gems. You should go south to her house and ask her!",
            "I'm sorry this isn't much of a welcome, but the fate of the village is at stake!",
            "After you get the first gem from the witch, come ask me again, and we can figure out what to do next!"

            "I apologise for my reaction, but I am very surprised to see another person! I haven't spoken to anyone in quite some time How did you even get in?",
            "That forest had been infested with monsters for quite some time, and I was trapped here. I can only thank you for defeating them.",

            "Before the monsters came, my beautiful wife and I used to live here with our son. We would plant flowers, walk together in the forest, it was perfect.",
            "My wife said they were just bullies, and my son agreed. I told them it was too dangerous, but she insisted on standing up to them. She was always so brave...",
            "Well anyways.",
            "I miss them terribly, and I've stayed at home ever since. In fact, I should apologise again! ",
            "Since losing them I've not exactly taken care of the place. Everything is in disarray, I'm in no state to host guests.",
            "But... I don't suppose you could lend me a hand? I can't get around anymore like I used to, and it would make the world of a difference to a lonely old man like me.",
            "I know it's a lot to ask, but would you be able to start by replanting the flowers in the flower bed outside? They were so beautiful, but they haven't bloomed in a long time.",
            "After that, come back and ask me what to do next! "
